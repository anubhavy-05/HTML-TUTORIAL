Lecture 9 – Animated Circle (Overview Only)
==========================================

Purpose
-------
Lecture 9 introduces a basic visual effect using a circular element whose background color changes repeatedly. The goal is to understand how an element can be styled and animated conceptually without diving into code specifics here.

Included Files
--------------
- `index.html` – The page that displays the animated circular element.
- `style for exercise8.5.css` – Styles and animation rules referenced by the page.

Concepts Demonstrated
---------------------
- Creating a circular shape by adjusting size and corner rounding.
- Positioning an element at a chosen spot within the page.
- Applying an animation that continuously updates the appearance over very short repeated intervals.
- Introducing a delay before an animation begins.
- Looping an animation indefinitely.

How to View
-----------
You can open the lecture page by locating the folder and launching the HTML file in any modern web browser. Optionally, you may run a simple local server from the project’s root folder and navigate to the lecture’s directory through a browser.

Suggested Enhancements
----------------------
- Add a visible effect when the user hovers over the circle (for example, pausing the movement or changing the outline).
- Experiment with a slower or faster transition to observe timing differences.
- Introduce more than two color stages for a smoother or more varied cycle.
- Combine color changes with size or position adjustments for a more dynamic presentation.

Troubleshooting Tips
--------------------
- If the visual change does not appear, verify the stylesheet file name matches the link used in the page header.
- Ensure your browser has not cached an older version of the page; refresh if needed.
- Confirm the animation instructions are located in the stylesheet referenced by the HTML page.

Next Exploration
----------------
Try creating a second circle with different timing settings or a contrasting color pattern to compare how separate animated elements can coexist. Document what visual differences stand out the most.
